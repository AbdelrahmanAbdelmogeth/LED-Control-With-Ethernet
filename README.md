# LED-Control-With-Ethernet

This project shows how the ETHERNET can be used in microcontroller based projects. In this
project a Serial Ethernet Board (www.mikroe.com) is connected to the EasyPIC V7 development
board.
The project uses the Web Browser method to establish Ethernet based communica¬Åon between
a PC and the microcontroller system.
The PC is the client and the microcontroller system is the server.
Two LEDs (LED A and LED B) are connected to the microcontroller system. These LEDs are toggled
remotely by entering commands on the PC. The HTTP protocol is used in the project
